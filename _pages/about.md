<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>
I am a Ph.D student from RF & Microwave Research Group at University College Dublin (UCD), supervised by Prof. Anding Zhu. I received my B.E. and M.E. degrees from South China University of Technology (SCUT), Guangzhou, China, in 2019 and 2022, respectively.

My current research interests include integrated high-efficiency  power amplifier (PA) design, and next-generation transmitter design.

[A 24-to-30-GHz GaN MMIC Doherty Power Amplifier Using Reduced Peaking Intrinsic Output Impedance for Bandwidth Extension](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10848253)

Ruijia Liu; **Haoyang Jia**; Lin Qi; Anding Zhu

[**Project**](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=cVIPhIMAAAAJ&sortby=pubdate&citation_for_view=cVIPhIMAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C) <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC'></span></strong>
- This presented a millimetre-wave gallium nitride (GaN) monolithic microwave integrated circuit (MMIC) Doherty power amplifier (DPA) for 5G-NR applications. The bandwidth of the DPA is extended by reducing the intrinsic output impedance of the power-stage peaking transistor at the back-off by selecting a proper gate bias voltage.

[An Ultracompact Bidirectional CMOS Gate-Switching Cascode Amplifier for Millimeter-Wave Transceiver Front End](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10817129)

[**Project**](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=cVIPhIMAAAAJ&sortby=pubdate&citation_for_view=cVIPhIMAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC) <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC'></span></strong>
- This work proposed an ultra-compact single-channel bidirectional amplifier architecture. The bi-directional gate-switching cascode amplifier is
leveraged in TRX front end to reduce the leakage current in transmitting (TX) and receiving (RX) mode to enhance system performance with an ultra-compact size.

[A 26-GHz GaN MMIC load-modulated balanced amplifier with miniaturized dual-loop coupler](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10591344)

Ruijia Liu; **Haoyang Jia**; Lin Qi; Anding Zhu

[**Project**](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=cVIPhIMAAAAJ&sortby=pubdate&citation_for_view=cVIPhIMAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC) <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC'></span></strong>
- This work proposed the miniaturized dual-loop (MDL) coupler that reduced the chip area while ensuring good isolation without compromising the load modulation of the LMBA. The miniaturized coupler facilitates the implementation of millimeter-wave LMBA in monolithic microwave-integrated circuits (MMICs).
